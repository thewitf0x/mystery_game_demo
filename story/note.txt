The note is written in a wiry, spindly hand.
It's not your handwriting, or is it? You don't think it is.
You could check with the pen.
It looks like whoever wrote it was hardly literate, or very out of it.
    1. Read the message.
    2. Write something with the pen for comparison.
    3. Destroy the note.
    4. Leave it alone.
