The oven is in a dire state.
Burnt remnants of food are scattered across the hobs.
Fat puddles are smeared over its surface.
The knobs and dials practically glisten with grease.
A pan nearby has some charred, floppy vegetables inside.
The oven door is ajar and a low hiss indicates gas is still coming out.
    1. 'ooh, a stir fry! I'm starved.' Spark the ignition.
    2. 'better turn this off before I black out again.' Disable the gas.
    3. I'll come back to it. Leave the oven alone.
