Darkness...

...more darkness...

...a bit of dull, shapeless sound, but mostly darkness...

You wake up. Your head hurts. You open your eyes but it's quite dark.
You try to sit up, but you bang your head on something.
There's a horrible, potent, overwhelming smell of gas.

You realise, with a sinking feeling: 
    1. my head is in the oven!
    2. I am blind!
