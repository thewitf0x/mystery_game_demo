A rush of fresh air hits your face. It's raining, but you don't care.
You reach out and rejoice at the wet droplets.
You're reminded of that scene from Shawshank Redemption, only
you don't feel quite so elated as that. After all, you haven't
escaped yet. And you have no idea what happened or why.
Peering out, you face a sudden overwhelming surge of vertigo.
You must be in one of the upper storey's of a tower block.
The street looks miles away below. No-one would even hear you scream.
But you weren't going to scream anyway, were you?
