Behind the scarred mirror surface, you look back at yourself.
You look pretty bad, but those pills have made you perk up a bit.
There's still no colour in your pallid cheeks, and your eyes are weary,
half closed, as though the lids are feeling more susceptible to gravity than
the rest of you.

You don't have a health bar, but if you did, you imagine your health
would be somewhere around 50/100.
