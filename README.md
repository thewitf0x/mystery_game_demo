This is a working demo version of an adventure game I simply called 'mystery'.
It's a command line text adventure.

To play, simply download the repository and run ruby play.rb from the command line.

The code is a little messy as I was learning while I went along, (eg. if/elsif/else versus case/when/else statements).
Happy to have feedback.

ps. the demo ends when you leave the room, so explore everything inside first!
